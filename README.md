## General info
First project focuses on the classic frozen lake problem. There are two variations to the problem:
* standard 4x4 map
* random 10x10 map with 25% holes

Three model free reinforcement techniques are tested:
* first-visit Monte Carlo withour exploring start
* SARSA with epsilon-greedy selection
* Q-learning with epsilon-greedy selection
	
## Packages
Project uses Python:
* Python version: 3.6.12
* Numpy version: 1.19.1
* Matplotlib version: 3.3.1
* OpenAI gym version: 0.17.3
